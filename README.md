## As part of new role as software engineer at Atlassian on the Bitbucket Data Privay and Security
Team I use Django A LOT. Since I only have experience with Flask, Go's net/http (and 3rd party
packages), and FastAPI, and not Django, I am walking through the famous Django app tutorial for
making your first Django web application. This repo stores my first Django apps code from the 
tutorial.
